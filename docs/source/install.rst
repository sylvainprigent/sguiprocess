Install
=======

This section contains the instructions to install ``BioImageApp``, ``BioImagePy`` and the toolboxes
to have a local working instance of ``BioImageApp``.
This instructions are for manual install. Prepackaged solutions are availabale `here <https://project.inria.fr/bioimageit/install/>`_ 

Install bioimageit_core
-----------------------

BioImageIT GUI depends on ``bioimageit_core``. To install ``bioimageit_core`` run the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir bioimageit
    git clone https://github.com/bioimageit/bioimageit_core.git
    cd bioimageit_core
    python -m pip install ./bioimageit_core


Install toolboxes
-----------------

``bioimageit_core`` uses a toolboxes index of remotely packaged tools. The toolboxes index is not installed by default.
To install the toolboxes run the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

    cd bioimageit
    git clone https://github.com/bioimageit/bioimageit-toolboxes.git
    cd bioimageit_core
    python3 install.py

The install script unpack the toolboxes, and create a configuration file. The install script ask your user name. This is
the username that will appear in the metadata files generated by ``bioimageit_core``

Configure bioimageit_core
-------------------------

If you need to manually configure ``bioimageit_core`` you need to edit the ``config.json`` file. You copy & paste
the ``config.sample.json`` available in the ``bioimageit_core`` root directory, or you can use the ``config.json``
file generated by the install script. The configuration file looks like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "metadata": {
            "service": "LOCAL"
        },
        "process": {
            "service": "LOCAL",
            "xml_dirs": [
                "/use/absolute/path/to/bioimageit/toolboxes/tools"
            ],
            "categories": "/use/absolute/path/to/bioimageit/toolboxes/toolboxes.json",
            "tools": "/use/absolute/path/to/bioimageit/toolboxes/tools.json"
        },
        "runner": {
            "service": "SINGULARITY"
        },
        "user": {
            "name": "your user name"
        }
    } 

The ``metadata`` section allows to configure how the metadata are handled. In the exemple above, we use the LOCAL
service that have no settings.

The ``process`` section contains all the processing tools desciptions. In the example above, we use the LOCAL service
meaning that all the tools informations (XML wrappers) are copied locally. The variable ``xml_dirs`` is the path of the
directories containing the processing tools XML wrappers. The variable ``categories`` is the path to the JSON file
containing the toolboxes list. The variable ``tools`` is the path to the index file containing the list of all the
available tools.

The ``runner`` section contains the processing tools runner configuration. In the example above, we use Singularity to
run tools that are packaged in Docker containers.

Finally, the ``user`` section contains the user name that will be printed in the metadata every time a data is imported
or processed by this instance of ``bioimageit_core``. This allows traceability.


Install BioImageIT GUI
----------------------

To install ``BioImageIT GUI`` run the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell
